Defining Big Data,Isitor Emmanuel|Clare Stanier,"As Big Data becomes better understood, there is a need for a comprehensive definition of Big Data to support work in fields such as data quality for Big Data. Existing definitions of Big Data define Big Data by comparison with existing, usually relational, definitions, or define Big Data in terms of data characteristics or use an approach which combines data characteristics with the Big Data environment. In this paper we examine existing definitions of Big Data and discuss the strengths and limitations of the different approaches, with particular reference to issues related to data quality in Big Data. We identify the issues presented by incomplete or inconsistent definitions. We propose an alternative definition and relate this definition to our work on quality in Big Data.",November 2016  ,BDAW '16: Proceedings of the International Conference on Big Data and Advanced Wireless Technologies,

Querying big data,Boris Novikov|Natalia Vassilieva|Anna Yarygina,"The term ""Big Data"" became a buzzword and is widely used in both research and industrial worlds. Typically the concept of big data assumes a variety of different sources of information and velocity of complex analytical processing, rather than just a huge and growing volume of data. All variety, velocity, and volume create new research challenges, as nearly all techniques and tools commonly used in data processing have to be re-considered. Variety and uncertainty of big data require a mixture of exact and similarity search and grouping of complex objects based on different attributes.

Healthcare Big Data: Challenges and Opportunities,M-Tahar Kechadi,"In healthcare sector huge quantities of data about patients and their medical conditions have been gathered through clinical databases and various other healthcare processes. Currently, it records nearly all aspects of care, including patient personal information, clinical trials, hospital records, diagnosis, medication, test results, imaging data, costs, administrative reports, etc. Like in other application domains, the big data revolution holds also great promise in the area of healthcare, as the available data about individual patients is very rich, and hides crucial knowledge that can be exploited to improve patients' care while reducing its cost. For instance, in 2012 worldwide collected healthcare data was estimated to be in the region of 500 petabytes and it is expected to grow 50 times more in 2020 (25 Exabytes). Turning this massive amount of data into knowledge that can be used to identify needs, predict and prevent critical patients' conditions, and help practitioners to make rapid and accurate decisions is not only a desire but is of urgent and crucial necessity. Therefore, healthcare organisations must have the ability to manage and analyse their data in a rapid and efficient manner to answer several critical questions related to diseases, treatments, patients' behaviours, and care management. However, building such system faces huge challenges: 1) data complexity, 2) Privacy, security, ethical, legal, and social issues, and 3) Interoperability, portability, and compatibility. We will discuss all these challenges and the requirements of healthcare ecosystem.

Effective Big Data Visualization,Murali Mani|Si Fei,"In the last several years, big data analytics has found an increasing role in our everyday lives. Data visualization has long been accepted as an integral part of data analytics. However, data visualization systems are not equipped to handle the complexities typically found in big data. Our work examines effective ways of visualizing big data, while also realizing that most visualization processes are interactive. During an interactive visualization session, an analyst issues several visualization requests, each of which builds on prior visualizations. In our approach, we integrate a distributed data processing system that can effectively process big data with a visualization system that can provide effective interactive visualization but for smaller amounts of data. The analyst's current request is used to infer contextual information about the analyst such as their expertise and tolerance for delay. This information is used to carefully determine additional data that can be sent to the visualization system for decreasing the response time for future requests, thus providing a better experience for the analyst and increasing their productivity.",July 2017  ,IDEAS '17: Proceedings of the 21st International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium,

The purpose of this study is to investigate the direction Florida's single-family homes constructed between the years 2009 and 2018 are taking with respect to energy efficiency by analyzing their energy characteristics through big data analysis. Therefore, this study (a) developed a comprehensive literature review of the existing energy-efficient design strategies adopted in Florida. In addition, (b) explained the process of collecting information about materials and design strategies used in single-family houses constructed between the years 2009 and 2018, from energy forms prepared in the framework of the permit application process at every local building permit department in different counties all over Florida. Finally, (c) analyzed the evolution of information collected throughout the years, including but not limited to wall types, ceiling types, ducts' location, windows' features, heating and cooling systems, in the different climate zones of Florida influencing the building performance. The results of this big data analysis indicated that, on the average, single-family homes in Florida tended to get more energy-efficient and sustainable throughout the last decade (2009-2018).

Big Data Quality Metrics for Sentiment Analysis Approaches,Imane El Alaoui|Youssef Gahi|Rochdi Messoussi,"In a world increasingly connected, and in which information flows quickly and affects a very large number of people, sentiment analysis has seen a spectacular development over the past ten years. This is due to the fact that the explosion of social networks has allowed anyone with internet access to publicly express his opinion. Moreover, the emergence of big data has brought enormous opportunities and powerful storage and analytics tools to the field of sentiment analysis. However, big data introduces new variables and constraints that could radically affect the traditional models of sentiment analysis. Therefore, new concerns, such as big data quality, have to be addressed to get the most out of big data. To the best of our knowledge, no contributions have been published so far which address big data quality in SA throughout its different processes. In this paper, we first highlight the most important big data quality metrics to consider in any big data project. Then, we show how these metrics could be specifically considered in SA approaches and this for each phase in the big data value chain.",June 2019  ,BDE 2019: Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Big Data Engineering,
Fast Mode Regression in Big Data Analysis,Keming Yu|Katerina Aristodemou|Frauke Becker|Joann Lord,"Grasping hidden patterns and unknown correlations of big data quickly and precisely is required in our time. Developing methodology for big data is the focus of big data analysis. Methods do not need to be expensive but meaningful and easy to implement. This paper proposes a mode-based fast pattern grasping method and mode-based fully parametric regression for big data analysis. By taking more than a decade of the 'Health Survey for England' data as an example, we apply the method to uncover the dependency of a response variable on other factors. The dependency relation can be used to check the effect of covariances on the pattern and make pattern or trend prediction easily and quickly.",August 2014  ,BigDataScience '14: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Big Data Science and Computing,
Efficient Big Data Clustering,Michele Ianni|Elio Masciari|Giuseppe M. Mazzeo|Carlo Zaniolo,"The need to support advanced analytics on Big Data is driving data scientist' interest toward massively parallel distributed systems and software platforms, such as Map-Reduce and Spark, that make possible their scalable utilization. However, when complex data mining algorithms are required, their fully scalable deployment on such platforms faces a number of technical challenges that grow with the complexity of the algorithms involved. Thus algorithms, that were originally designed for a sequential nature, must often be redesigned in order to effectively use the distributed computational resources. In this paper, we explore these problems, and then propose a solution which has proven to be very effective on the complex hierarchical clustering algorithm CLUBS+. By using four stages of successive refinements, CLUBS+ delivers high-quality clusters of data grouped around their centroids, working in a totally unsupervised fashion. Experimental results confirm the accuracy and scalability of CLUBS+.",June 2018  ,IDEAS '18: Proceedings of the 22nd International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium,

Security Challenges for Big Data and IoT,Sitalakshmi Venkatraman|Anthony Overmars|Kiran Fahd|Sazia Parvin|Samuel Kaspi,"Recently, two terms, namely Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) have gained popularity individually. However, their interconnections are not fully explored and understood. It is expected that the fusion of Big Data and IoT would create many complex systems for smart cities. While the data from IoT lies in Big Data, the scale of operations are completely different in terms of providing the required real-time analytics for such smart systems. Even though NoSQL databases and other next generation solutions could be deployed to achieve real-time responses, the major security challenges need to be understood as mission critical and sensitive data intertwines Big Data and IoT. In this paper, we identify the security challenges shared by the closely-knit Big Data and IoT in three main risk areas: i) NoSQL security vulnerabilities, ii) mobile IoT (M-IoT) security and privacy constraints and iii) encryption key security threats. We perform a comparative study of security vulnerabilities of NoSQL databases and identify the security and privacy constraints of M-IoT networks. Encryption key attacks for resource constrained IoT devices are also illustrated mathematically. Overall, this paper explores new research directions in these prime areas of security and privacy that would result in solution opportunities for a meaningful fusion of Big Data and IoT for a smart environment.",January 2020  ,BDET 2020: Proceedings of the 2020 2nd International Conference on Big Data Engineering and Technology,
Multimedia Big Data Analytics: A Survey,Samira Pouyanfar|Yimin Yang|Shu-Ching Chen|Mei-Ling Shyu|S. S. Iyengar,"With the proliferation of online services and mobile technologies, the world has stepped into a multimedia big data era. A vast amount of research work has been done in the multimedia area, targeting different aspects of big data analytics, such as the capture, storage, indexing, mining, and retrieval of multimedia big data. However, very few research work provides a complete survey of the whole pine-line of the multimedia big data analytics, including the management and analysis of the large amount of data, the challenges and opportunities, and the promising research directions. To serve this purpose, we present this survey, which conducts a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research work on multimedia big data analytics. It also aims to bridge the gap between multimedia challenges and big data solutions by providing the current big data frameworks, their applications in multimedia analyses, the strengths and limitations of the existing methods, and the potential future directions in multimedia big data analytics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that targets the most recent multimedia management techniques for very large-scale data and also provides the research studies and technologies advancing the multimedia analyses in this big data era.",January 2019  ,ACM Computing Surveys,
"Big Data: New Paradigm or ""Sound and Fury, Signifying Nothing""?",Andrei Broder|Lada Adamic|Michael Franklin|Maarten de Rijke|Eric Xing|Kai Yu,"The Gartner's 2014 Hype Cycle released last August moves Big Data technology from the Peak of Inflated Expectations to the beginning of the Trough of Disillusionment when interest starts to wane as reality does not live up to previous promises. As the hype is starting to dissipate it is worth asking what Big Data (however defined) means from a scientific perspective: Did the emergence of gigantic corpora exposed the limits of classical information retrieval and data mining and led to new concepts and challenges, the way say, the study of electromagnetism showed the limits of Newtonian mechanics and led to Relativity Theory, or is it all just ""sound and fury, signifying nothing"", simply a matter of scaling up well understood technologies? To answer this question, we have assembled a distinguished panel of eminent scientists, from both Industry and Academia: Lada Adamic (Facebook), Michael Franklin (University of California at Berkeley), Maarten de Rijke (University of Amsterdam), Eric Xing (Carnegie Mellon University), and Kai Yu (Baidu) will share their point of view and take questions from the moderator and the audience.",February 2015  ,WSDM '15: Proceedings of the Eighth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining,
Big Data Design,Alberto Abell√≥,"It is widely accepted today that Relational databases are not appropriate in highly distributed shared-nothing architectures of commodity hardware, that need to handle poorly structured heterogeneous data. This has brought the blooming of NoSQL systems with the purpose of mitigating such problem, specially in the presence of analytical workloads. Thus, the change in the data model and the new analytical needs beyond OLAP take us to rethink methods and models to design and manage these newborn repositories. In this paper, we will analyze state of the art and future research directions.",October 2015  ,DOLAP '15: Proceedings of the ACM Eighteenth International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP,
Big data visualization: promises & pitfalls,Katherine Hepworth,"A few weeks ago, I was having dinner with a friend when a controversial subject came up. My friend had an extremely strong opinion about the harm caused by vaccination, and his argument went something like this: ""I've seen the data. There was an infographic laying it all out."" He couldn't remember specific numbers from the visualization he'd seen or the author of the article. He couldn't even remember the name of the publication, but the data visualization's overall argument was firmly lodged in his mind. His situation is not unique, and it provides telling insights on how we, as humans, perceive and respond to big data visualization.",December 2016  ,Communication Design Quarterly,

Big Data and New Data Warehousing Approaches,Marina Ptiƒçek|Boris Vrdoljak,"Big data are a data trend present around us mainly through Internet -- social networks and smart devices and meters -- mostly without us being aware of them. Also they are a fact that both industry and scientific research needs to deal with. They are interesting from analytical point of view, for they contain knowledge that cannot be ignored and left unused. Traditional system that supports the advanced analytics and knowledge extraction -- data warehouse -- is not able to cope with large amounts of fast incoming various and unstructured data, and may be facing a paradigm shift in terms of utilized concepts, technologies and methodologies, which have become a very active research area in the last few years. This paper provides an overview of research trends important for the big data warehousing, concepts and technologies used for data storage and (ETL) processing, and research approaches done in attempts to empower traditional data warehouses for handling big data.",September 2017  ,ICCBDC 2017: Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Cloud and Big Data Computing,
